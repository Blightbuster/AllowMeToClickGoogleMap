# AllowMeToClickGoogleMap Addon Readme

## Description
AllowMeToClickGoogleMap is an addon designed to streamline your browsing experience by adding a convenient "Open map" button to search results. With a single click, you can seamlessly redirect to Google Maps to view the location corresponding to the search result.

## Why?
https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-is-rolling-out-new-search-features-in-europe/508439/

> Google is rolling out these features in Europe because of a legal obligation to comply with the DMA.
> The DMA is new EU legislation aimed at regulating large technology companies designated as “gatekeepers” due to their market dominance.
> It will come into effect in March and requires significant changes by companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and ByteDance.
> As a designated gatekeeper, Google must adjust products like Search, Maps, and the Android app store to comply.
